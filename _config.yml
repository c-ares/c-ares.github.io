title: "c-ares: a modern asynchronous DNS resolver"
description: >-
  c-ares is a modern DNS (stub) resolver library, written in C. It provides
  interfaces for asynchronous queries while trying to abstract the intricacies
  of the underlying DNS protocol. It was originally intended for applications
  which need to perform DNS queries without blocking, or need to perform multiple
  DNS queries in parallel.
